    <h1>Big Ideas</h1>
    <p>In this unit, I practiced transforming an idea into a functional program by planning, testing, presenting, and explaining my design choices. I kept notes and screenshots as documentation and created a short narration to demonstrate how the program operates and why I built it.:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
1.1 Collaboration: We worked as a team to divide tasks and solve problems together, making sure not to block each other and reducing bugs in the process.
1.2 Program Design & Development: I created basic algorithms, drafted pseudocode, and applied debugging methods like print statements and step-by-step testing to refine the program’s behavior.
1.3 Program Function & Purpose: I set a clear objective, identified the intended audience, structured the input and output processes, organized the code into functions and procedures, and documented it carefully so others can easily understand and reuse it.
1.4 Identifying & Correcting Errors: I wrote small tests, checked edge cases, and added error-handling measures to prevent crashes and handle invalid inputs smoothly.</li>
